# Final Project: Test 2

This is a second itteration where I started playing with a simulation of vector fields/flow fields. 

Using the ofxUI addon a GUI was made to demonstrate how changing parameters can change the behavior of the system. 


NOTE: Each time you change a parameter in the GUI you have to press spacebar to update the system.

Here is an early example of trying to work out the code. I had to work on special boundary conditions to remove these lines that were occuring each time a particle passed through the boudaries.
