# Final Project
 
## *microMACRO: Creative Coding from Dark Matter to String Theory*


###Project Concept

This project is an exploration in the duality between the micro and the macro â€” a duality that, while seemingly different, is inherently similar, fractal, reflective and mirrored. Through experiments using the OpenFrameworks platform, I made a series of creative visuals that may prompt us all to reflect on the beauty and unity in the microMARO-cosm.

###Technical Notes

NOTE: Each time you change a parameter in the GUI you have to press spacebar to update the system.


Addons:

1) ofxUI -  GUI is made to demonstrate how changing parameters can change the behavior of the system. 

2) ofxPostProssesing - playing with other visual effects

###Future Iterations

I tried to play with simulations of more fluid like motion. Here is an image from [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov/ames/magnetic-field-loops-on-the-sun/#.VH5hrKTF8m-) of supercomputer simulation of magnetic field loops on the Sun.

I tried working with two addons (ofxMSAFluid and ofxFluid) only to discover that neither of these support 3D. I hope for future itterations of this project to be able to implament a 3D version of fluid motion and further my research into fluid motion in general.

###Precedents


Inspiration was taken from the work of:

1) Frankie Zafe's work [Harmonic Plants](http://www.frankiezafe.org/index.php?id=117&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=261&cHash=e2457a72c7e11c6bcdfceeabc9512c7d).

2) Ryan Alexander's work [Mycilium](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/mycelium-processing/).
