# Midterm: Creative Simulations

My Midterm is based on my fascination with the fundamental building blocks of the universe. As a former astrophysicist, my creative interests lie somewhere in the intersection of art and science. I will continue to push this concept of "simulating" the geometries that govern our entire universe.

Here is a short compilation of the 6 pieces that I made for the midterm:

Here is the work of [Reza Syed](http://www.syedrezaali.com/#/a-drifting-up/) who I based a few of these early sketches off of. Reza is an amazing code artist!!! I have long admired his work and can only hope to one day be as talented a coding artist as he is!

# Homework: Week 03

## Non-code:
There are particles everywhere. In fact, everything is made up of particles. We are all part of the cosmic soup that was created after the Big Bang. Cosmic Dust is everywhere. Here is a video I made of "cosmis dust" created by a falling brick wall in NYC.  [Particles Short](https://vimeo.com/106728861)
